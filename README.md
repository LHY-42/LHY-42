I am an aspiring student programmer as well as a member of the Hwa Chong Robotics Club. Currently, I pursue the fields of Web Development and am looking into App Development (Class of 2022 for the [Swift Accelerator Programme](https://swiftinsg.com), as well as (of course) robotics.

Apart from software development (and robotics), I'm also a classical music enthusiast. Scharwenka <3.

MO-Guide is a simple, responsive Math Olympiad webpage implemented using Next.js. With simple to understand notes and video resources for primary students to grasp fundamental but tough concepts of the field of Math Olympiad, we hope that this project will be of use to others.

OurHCI is a social media platform for Hwa Chong students made using Django (and will be ported to mobile platforms using Flutter/React Native: we'll decide when we get there) meant to serve as not only a socialising platform but also a stage for students to freely express their thoughts. ~~Unfortunately, as this is a project for School, there is **censorship**.~~

Politically incorrect posts ~~must~~ will be tagged with "This post has controversial content" for example, and there will be student moderators who review posts flagged or reported by other students. Repeatedly posting sh\*t will result in a drop in "social credit", a reputation system which will inform users of how trustworthy a person's posts might be.
